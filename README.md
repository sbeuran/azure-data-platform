# Bosch Supply Chain Data Platform

## Overview

This repository contains the infrastructure and data platform implementation for Bosch's supply chain prediction and logistics issue resolution system. The platform is built on Azure using modern cloud-native technologies and follows enterprise-grade security, scalability, and reliability principles.

## Architecture

The platform implements a comprehensive data architecture that includes:

- **Data Ingestion**: Multi-source data collection from SAP S/4HANA, logistics partners, IoT devices, and external APIs
- **Data Processing**: Real-time and batch processing using Azure Databricks with Delta Lake
- **Data Storage**: Multi-zone data lake (Bronze/Silver/Gold) with Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
- **Data Analytics**: Azure Synapse Analytics for data warehousing and business intelligence
- **ML/AI**: Machine learning pipelines for predictive analytics and anomaly detection
- **Security**: Enterprise-grade security with Azure Key Vault, RBAC, and private endpoints
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive observability with Azure Monitor and custom dashboards

## Key Features

### Supply Chain Analytics
- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecast demand, identify potential stockouts, and predict shipping delays
- **Anomaly Detection**: Real-time detection of supply chain disruptions and logistics issues
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Automated analysis of supply chain failures and bottlenecks
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track KPIs across the entire supply chain ecosystem

### Data Sources
- SAP S/4HANA (Materials Management, Sales & Distribution, Production Planning)
- Logistics Partners (Carriers, 3PL providers)
- IoT Sensors (Warehouse, Factory, Transportation)
- External APIs (Weather, Traffic, Market data)
- ERP Systems (Supplier data, Purchase orders)

### Technology Stack
- **Cloud Platform**: Microsoft Azure
- **Data Processing**: Azure Databricks, Apache Spark, Delta Lake
- **Data Orchestration**: Azure Data Factory
- **Data Warehouse**: Azure Synapse Analytics
- **ML/AI**: Azure Machine Learning, MLflow, TensorFlow
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform, Azure Resource Manager
- **Security**: Azure Key Vault, Azure Active Directory, Private Endpoints
- **Monitoring**: Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, Application Insights
